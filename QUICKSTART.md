2. Tap **Create an account**

   - **Email** - your email address
   - **Password** - 8 characters minimum
4. Tap **Create Account**

> Tip: After signing up, add the app to your home screen for the best experience. On iPhone, tap the Share button then "Add to Home Screen." On Android, tap the menu then "Install app."

## Step 2: Create Your Crew

After signing up, you'll land on the Welcome screen.

1. Tap **"I'm the Patient"**
2. Give your crew a name - make it fun!
   - Examples: "Team Sarah", "The Avengers", "Sarah's Cancer Crew"
3. Tap **Create Crew**
4. You'll see your **invite code** - an 8-letter code like `A7BX3KMP`
5. Tap the copy button and **send this code to your people**

> This code is how your friends and family join your crew. Send it via text, email, group chat, wherever your people are.

## Step 3: Explore Your Dashboard

Once your crew is created, you'll see your dashboard with:

- **Point Balance** - You start with **500 points**. You spend points to request help, and earn them back through self-care (more on that below).
- **Quick Actions** - Shortcuts to Play Card, Self-Care, Tasks, and Crew
- **Invite Code** - Tap to copy and share anytime
- **Recent Activity** - See what's happening in your crew

## Step 4: Play Your Cancer Card (Request Help)

This is the core of the app - asking for help without the awkward "can you..." conversation.

1. Tap the big purple **Play Card** button (center of the bottom bar)
2. **Pick a task** from the menu. Categories include:
   - Food & Drinks (meals, groceries, milkshakes)
   - Transportation (chemo rides, pharmacy runs)
   - Household (laundry, dishes, yard work)
   - Errands (post office, returns)
   - Company & Comfort (movie night, sit with me)
   - Pet Care (dog walks, vet trips)
   - Kid Care (school pickup, babysitting)
   - Wildcard (custom or surprise requests)
3. **Choose how to assign it:**
   - **Open** - Anyone on your crew can claim it
   - **Direct** - Assign it to a specific crew member
   - **Auction** - Your crew bids (lowest point cost wins - they're competing to help you!)
4. **Set urgency:** Whenever, Today, or ASAP
5. Tap **Play My Cancer Card** to confirm

> Each task has a point cost. Don't worry about running low - points can go negative. The point system is there to make it fun, not to limit you. **Never hesitate to ask for help.**

## Step 5: Log Your Self-Care

Earn points back by taking care of yourself! Tap the **heart icon** on the bottom bar.

You'll see buttons to log daily wins:

| Activity | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Completed chemo session | +100 |
| Attended doctor appointment | +50 |
| Did something fun / laughed | +30 |
| Took all medications today | +25 |
| Good sleep | +20 |
| Went for a walk / light exercise | +15 |
| Ate a full meal | +15 |
| Drank enough water | +10 |

**Streaks matter!** Log milestones multiple days in a row for bonus points:
- 3-day streak: **+50 bonus**
- 7-day streak: **+150 bonus**

> Just tap each one as you complete it throughout the day. The progress bar at the top shows how many you've logged today.

## Step 6: Share These Instructions With Your Crew

Your crew members need to:

1. Open the app link you send them
2. Tap **Create an account** (name, email, password)
3. On the Welcome screen, tap **"I'm the Support"**
4. Enter the **invite code** you shared with them
5. They're in! They'll see available tasks and can start claiming them
